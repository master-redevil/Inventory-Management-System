## 1. Core Business Goals
Your system must solve these problems:

## Detailed Solutions

### Stock losses
**Problem:** Items disappear without explanation (theft, damage, miscounts, data entry errors).

**Solution:**  
The system implements a complete **audit trail** for every stock movement. Every addition, removal, transfer, adjustment, sale, return, or write-off records:  
- Who performed the action (user ID)  
- When it happened (timestamp)  
- What exactly changed (item, quantity, before/after)  
- Reason code / reference (e.g. "Damaged", "Sold - Order #123", "Cycle count adjustment")  
- Optional: photos, notes, or approval reference  

This allows complete traceability — any discrepancy can be traced back to the responsible person/action in seconds.

### Over-stocking
**Problem:** Too much capital tied up in slow-moving or obsolete inventory.

**Solution:**  
- Automatic **dead stock** flagging: items with no movement in X months (configurable, e.g. 6–12 months)  
- **Stock aging reports**: buckets like 0-3 mo, 3-6 mo, 6-12 mo, >12 mo  
- Reorder alerts only trigger when projected stock falls below reorder point (not just when current stock is low)  
- Excess stock warnings when current stock > max level or forecasted demand doesn't justify holdings  
- Slow-moving item reports to support clearance sales, promotions, or supplier returns

### Under-stocking
**Problem:** Running out of stock → lost sales, unhappy customers.

**Solution:**  
- **Demand forecasting**: using simple moving average, exponential smoothing, seasonal methods (configurable)  
- Reorder point (ROP) = lead time demand + safety stock  
- Safety stock calculation based on demand variability + lead time variability  
- **Stock-out risk score**: % likelihood of running out before next delivery  
- Early warnings when projected stock hits zero within lead time + review period  
- Critical item flagging for high-impact / high-margin products

### No visibility
**Problem:** Staff don't know real stock levels, especially across multiple locations/warehouses.

**Solution:**  
- Real-time inventory dashboard showing stock on hand per location/SKU  
- Multi-location support with tracked transfers between sites  
- Stock summary + detailed per-location breakdown  
- Mobile-friendly views so warehouse staff can check levels instantly  
- Low-stock & critical alerts pushed to relevant users/roles

### Supplier delays
**Problem:** Late deliveries disrupt replenishment plans.

**Solution:**  
- Full **purchase order lifecycle** tracking:  
  Draft → Approved → Sent → Acknowledged → In transit → Received (partial/full)  
- Expected vs actual delivery date recording  
- Supplier performance metrics: on-time delivery %, average delay, quality issues  
- Automatic delay detection → notifications & escalation to buyers/managers  
- ETA updates and automatic recalculation of reorder points when delays occur

### No accountability
**Problem:** Hard to know who approved what, who made expensive mistakes.

**Solution:**  
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Viewer, Warehouse operator, Purchaser, Approver, Admin, etc.  
- Approval workflows: e.g. purchase orders > $5,000 need manager approval  
- Audit trail on all sensitive actions (price changes, large adjustments, user permission changes)  
- Digital signatures / approval comments on key documents  
- Per-user activity log showing all actions in a period
