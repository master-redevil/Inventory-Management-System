# Alert & Automation System in Inventory Management

## What is the Alert & Automation System?

The **Alert & Automation System** is a proactive notification and automation layer that monitors inventory conditions in real-time and automatically triggers alerts or actions when predefined rules are met.

It shifts inventory management from reactive (checking reports manually) to proactive (system warns you before problems occur). This feature significantly reduces stockouts, expiry waste, delays, and overlooked issues.

The system works on a simple **[Trigger] → [Action]** model, allowing configurable rules that run continuously in the background.

## Key Alerts and Automations

The system supports critical alerts such as:

- **Stock < Reorder Level**  
  **Trigger**: Available stock falls below the predefined reorder point for an item.  
  **Action**: Auto email + dashboard alert.  
  *Purpose*: Prevents stockouts by notifying purchasing team to reorder in time.

- **Item near expiry**  
  **Trigger**: An item's expiry date is approaching (configurable thresholds: Alert 30 / 15 / 7 days before expiry).  
  **Action**: Automated notification.  
  *Purpose*: Prompts sales or operations to prioritize use/sale of near-expiry stock and minimize waste.

- **PO overdue**  
  **Trigger**: A Purchase Order's expected delivery date has passed without full receipt (supplier delay).  
  **Action**: Supplier delay alert.  
  *Purpose*: Enables follow-up with suppliers to avoid delays impacting operations.

- **Dead stock 90 days**  
  **Trigger**: An item has had no inward or outward movement for 90 days (or configurable period).  
  **Action**: Management warning.  
  *Purpose*: Highlights obsolete or slow-moving stock so management can take action (discount, write-off, return).

## How the System Works

1. **Rules are defined** with specific triggers (e.g., stock level, date comparisons, inactivity periods).
2. The **Realtime Inventory Engine** continuously evaluates these conditions.
3. When a trigger condition is met, the system automatically executes the configured **action**:
   - Send email/SMS to relevant users (purchaser, manager, warehouse staff)
   - Display prominent alert on dashboard
   - Log the event for tracking

## Benefits of an Alert & Automation System

- Prevents stockouts through timely reorder alerts
- Reduces expiry losses by flagging near-expiry items early
- Improves supplier accountability with overdue PO alerts
- Frees up management time — no need to manually check reports daily
- Highlights dead stock to optimize working capital
- Enables faster response to inventory risks
- Adds significant professional value through automation

By automating monitoring and notifications, the Alert & Automation System ensures that critical inventory events are never missed, making the entire inventory management process more reliable, efficient, and professional.
