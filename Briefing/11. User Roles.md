# User Roles & Permissions in Inventory Management

## What are User Roles?

The **User Roles** system defines different levels of access and responsibilities within the inventory management software. Each role is assigned specific permissions to ensure users can only perform actions relevant to their job function.

This role-based access control (RBAC) enhances security, maintains data integrity, prevents unauthorized changes, and supports accountability.

**Key Principle**:  
**Each role has screen-level permission control.**  
This means permissions are set at the individual screen/module level (e.g., can view Purchase Orders, can approve GRNs, can create stock adjustments, etc.), allowing very granular and customized access.

## Defined User Roles

The system includes the following predefined roles:

- **Super Admin**  
  Highest level of access.  
  Full control over the entire system including:  
  - User management (create/edit/delete users and roles)  
  - System configuration  
  - All modules and screens  
  - View and edit everything  
  Typically assigned to owners, IT administrators, or top management.

- **Inventory Manager**  
  Responsible for overall inventory oversight.  
  Can:  
  - Manage all inventory transactions  
  - Approve critical actions (e.g., stock adjustments, transfers)  
  - View and generate reports  
  - Set reorder levels and manage stock policies  
  - Usually has broad access but may not manage users/system settings.

- **Warehouse Staff**  
  Operational staff handling day-to-day warehouse activities.  
  Can:  
  - Create/receive Goods Receipt Notes (GRN)  
  - Perform stock issues/sales  
  - Record stock transfers  
  - Conduct physical counts and adjustments (with approval)  
  - Limited to warehouse-specific operations; no financial or configuration access.

- **Purchase Officer**  
  Handles procurement process.  
  Can:  
  - Create, edit, and send Purchase Orders (PO)  
  - View supplier details  
  - Track PO status and expected deliveries  
  - Typically cannot approve receipts or adjust stock directly.

- **Auditor**  
  Focused on compliance, verification, and review.  
  Can:  
  - View all transaction history, logs, and ledgers  
  - Access audit reports (user activity, adjustments, stock movements)  
  - Usually **view-only** access to most modules  
  - May have permission to export data for external audits.

- **Viewer**  
  Read-only access for monitoring purposes.  
  Can:  
  - View current stock levels, reports, and dashboards  
  - Cannot create, edit, approve, or delete any records  
  Ideal for executives, department heads, or external stakeholders who need visibility without modification rights.

## Benefits of Screen-Level Permission Control

- **Security**: Prevents accidental or malicious changes by restricting access to sensitive functions.
- **Segregation of Duties**: Critical for internal controls (e.g., person who creates PO cannot approve receipt).
- **Compliance**: Supports audit requirements by ensuring only authorized users perform certain actions.
- **Efficiency**: Users see only relevant screens, reducing clutter and confusion.
- **Flexibility**: Permissions can be customized per role or even per user if needed.

By implementing detailed, screen-level role-based permissions, the system ensures that every user operates within their defined scope — protecting data while enabling smooth, secure inventory operations.
