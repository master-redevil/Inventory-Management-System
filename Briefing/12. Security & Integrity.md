# Security & Integrity in Inventory Management

## What is Security & Integrity?

The **Security & Integrity** features form the protective foundation of a professional inventory management system. They ensure that data remains accurate, tamper-proof, recoverable, and accessible only to authorized users.

These controls safeguard against accidental errors, intentional fraud, data loss, and unauthorized access — making the system trustworthy for business-critical operations.

## Key Security & Integrity Features

- **No hard delete — only archive**  
  Records (e.g., Purchase Orders, GRNs, Issues, Adjustments) are **never permanently deleted**.  
  Instead, they are marked as "archived" or "inactive."  
  *Benefits*:  
  - Maintains complete historical data for audits  
  - Prevents accidental or malicious loss of transaction history  
  - Allows recovery if a record was mistakenly voided

- **Every action logged**  
  The system records a full audit trail of **who did what and when**.  
  Includes:  
  - User login/logout  
  - Create/edit/approve/view actions  
  - Stock adjustments, transfers, receipts, issues  
  *Benefits*:  
  - Enables traceability and accountability  
  - Supports fraud detection and investigation  
  - Essential for compliance and internal audits

- **Approval workflow**  
  Critical transactions require multi-step approval before taking effect.  
  Examples:  
  - Stock adjustments need supervisor approval

  *Benefits*:  
  - Enforces segregation of duties  
  - Reduces errors and prevents unauthorized changes

  - Secure HTTPS connections  
  *Benefits*:  
  - Protects against data breaches  
  - Ensures confidentiality  
  - Meets regulatory and compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC)

- **Backup scheduler**  
  Automated, regular backups of the entire database and system data.  
  Features may include:  
  - Daily/weekly scheduled backups  
  - Offsite or cloud storage options  
  - Versioned backups for point-in-time recovery  
  *Benefits*:
