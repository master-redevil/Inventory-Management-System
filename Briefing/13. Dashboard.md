# Dashboard KPIs in Inventory Management

## What are Dashboard KPIs?

The **Dashboard KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) provide a high-level, at-a-glance overview of the health and performance of your inventory operations. Displayed prominently on the main dashboard, these metrics allow managers and executives to quickly assess critical aspects of inventory without digging into detailed reports.

Real-time or near-real-time updates ensure decisions are based on current data, enabling proactive management of stock, costs, and supply chain efficiency.

## Key KPIs Displayed

- **Total Stock Value**  
  The total monetary value of all inventory currently on hand (calculated as quantity × cost price per item).  
  *Purpose*: Shows how much capital is tied up in inventory — critical for cash flow and working capital management.

- **Low Stock Items**  
  Count of products whose available stock has fallen below the predefined reorder level.  
  *Purpose*: Highlights immediate reordering needs to prevent stockouts and lost sales.

- **Dead Stock Value**  
  The total value of items classified as dead/slow-moving (no movement for a set period, e.g., 90–180 days).  
  *Purpose*: Identifies obsolete or unsellable stock that is wasting capital and storage space.

- **Monthly Consumption**  
  Average or total quantity/value of goods issued or sold in the current month.  
  *Purpose*: Reflects current demand rate — essential for forecasting and reorder quantity calculations.

- **Supplier Lead Time**  
  Average time (in days) taken by suppliers to deliver goods after a Purchase Order is placed.  
  *Purpose*: Measures supplier performance and helps set accurate safety stock and reorder points.

- **Stock Accuracy %**  
  Percentage accuracy between system-recorded stock and physical stock (usually measured via cycle counts or full stock takes).  
  Formula:  
  **(Physical Count / System Count) × 100** (averaged across audited items).  
  *Purpose*: Indicates reliability of inventory data — high accuracy (>98%) is a hallmark of professional inventory control.

## Benefits of Dashboard KPIs

- Instant visibility into inventory health for managers and executives
- Enables quick identification of issues (low stock, dead stock, poor accuracy)
- Supports better financial planning through total stock value monitoring
- Drives data-driven decisions on purchasing, supplier selection, and stock optimization
- Promotes accountability with clear, measurable performance indicators
- Saves time by eliminating the need to run multiple reports for basic oversight

By prominently displaying these essential KPIs on the dashboard, the system empowers users at all levels to monitor, react, and continuously improve inventory performance in real time.
