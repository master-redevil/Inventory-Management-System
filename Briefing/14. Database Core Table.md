# Database Core Tables in Inventory Management

## What are the Database Core Tables?

The **Database Core Tables** represent the foundational structure of the inventory management system's backend database. These tables store all essential data required for tracking products, transactions, users, and audit trails.

A well-designed relational database with these core tables ensures data consistency, supports realtime calculations, enables detailed reporting, and maintains security/integrity.

The list shown highlights the primary tables in the system schema.

## Core Tables and Their Purpose

- **batch**  
  Stores batch/lot information for items requiring traceability (e.g., expiry date, manufacturing batch).  
  Used for managing perishable or regulated products.

- **products**  
  Master table for all inventory items.  
  Contains product code, name, description, unit, cost price, selling price, category, reorder level, etc.

- **suppliers**  
  Details of vendors/suppliers.  
  Includes supplier name, contact, address, payment terms, lead time, performance history.

- **customers**  
  Records of customers (for sales tracking).  
  Stores customer name, contact, address, credit terms (if applicable).

- **purchase_orders**  
  Stores all Purchase Order records and line items.  
  Tracks PO number, supplier, items ordered, quantities, expected date, status, approvals.

- **grn**  
  Goods Receipt Note table.  
  Records actual receipts against POs, received quantities, batch/serial, location stored, inspector.

- **stock_ledger**  
  Central transaction ledger for all stock movements.  
  Every inflow/outflow (GRN, issue, transfer, adjustment) creates entries here for perpetual inventory tracking.

- **stock_adjustments**  
  Records all manual stock corrections.  
  Includes reason (damage, theft, expiry, count difference), quantity adjusted, approver.

- **stock_transfers**  
  Logs internal movements between locations/warehouses.  
  Tracks from/to location, quantity, approval.

- **users**  
  System user accounts.  
  Stores username, hashed password, role assignment, contact details, status (active/inactive).

- **roles**  
  Defines user roles (e.g., Super Admin, Inventory Manager, Warehouse Staff).  
  Linked to screen-level permissions.

- **permissions**  
  Granular permission mappings.  
  Defines which actions each role can perform on specific screens/modules.

- **activity_logs**  
  Audit trail table.  
  Logs every user action (login, create/edit/approve/delete/view) with timestamp, user ID, and details.

## Why These Tables Matter

- **Normalization & Integrity**: Separating data into dedicated tables prevents redundancy and ensures consistency.
- **Realtime Accuracy**: The `stock_ledger` acts as the single source of truth for all stock movements.
- **Security & Compliance**: `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, and `activity_logs` enforce access control and full auditability.
- **Scalability**: Clear table structure supports growth, multi-location operations, and advanced reporting.
- **Traceability**: Tables like `batch`, `grn`, and `stock_transfers` enable full forward/backward tracing.

This relational database design forms the robust backbone that powers all features — from realtime stock calculation to alerts, reporting, approvals, and security — making the entire inventory system reliable and professional.
