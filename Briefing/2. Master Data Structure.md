# 2. Master Data Structure - Inventory Management System (With Full Explanations)

## What is "Master Data"?

**Master data** is the consistent, accurate, and centrally managed core reference information that is shared across the entire system (inventory, sales, purchasing, accounting, reporting, etc.).

It changes rarely (unlike orders or stock movements), but when it is wrong or duplicated, it causes widespread problems: wrong prices on invoices, stock counted in wrong units, suppliers contacted at wrong addresses, duplicate products, failed forecasting, compliance failures, etc.

Master data is the foundation — "garbage in, garbage out". Good master data = reliable automation, accurate reports, clean analytics.

## A) Product Master (Item Master / SKU Master)

Central record for every sellable/tracked item.

| Field                          | Description / Purpose                                                                                   | Explanation / Why It Matters / Best Practices                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product ID (SKU)               | Unique identifier for the product                                                                       | The single most important field. Must be unique, consistent, human-readable if possible (e.g. TSH-BLK-M-001). Avoid pure sequential numbers if you ever integrate with other systems. |
| Product Name                   | Full descriptive name                                                                                   | Clear, consistent naming convention (e.g. "Men's Cotton T-Shirt Black Medium"). Used everywhere customers see — invoices, labels, e-commerce. |
| Category / Sub-Category        | Hierarchical grouping                                                                                   | Enables powerful filtering, sales analysis, margin reporting by category, dynamic pricing rules, shelf planning in stores/warehouses. |
| Brand                          | Brand or manufacturer name                                                                              | Critical for branded goods, supplier linkage, customer search, marketing analytics, returns/warranty handling.                   |
| Barcode / QR                   | Scannable identifier (UPC, EAN, Code128, QR)                                                            | Enables fast receiving, picking, POS sales, cycle counting. QR can store extra info (batch, expiry). Missing = slow operations.    |
| Cost Price                     | Purchase cost (can be average, last, FIFO, landed)                                                      | Drives profitability reporting (gross margin = sale price - cost). Use landed cost (freight+duties) for real accuracy.             |
| Sale Price                     | Standard selling price (can have tiered/multiple)                                                       | Basis for all sales transactions unless overridden. Keep updated for promotions, inflation.                                       |
| Unit of Measure (UoM)          | How item is bought/sold/stored (pcs, kg, box, roll, pack-12)                                            | Wrong UoM = huge counting errors (e.g. ordering 10 "boxes" but receiving 10 "pcs"). Support conversions if needed (1 box = 24 pcs). |
| Reorder Level                  | Stock quantity that triggers reorder alert                                                              | Safety buffer. Formula: lead time demand + safety stock. Too low = stockouts; too high = overstock.                               |
| Reorder Quantity               | Amount to order when reorder point is reached                                                           | Often EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) or supplier MOQ. Balances ordering cost vs holding cost.                                      |
| Expiry Date (optional)         | Date item becomes unsellable (food, pharma, cosmetics)                                                  | Enables FEFO (First Expiry First Out) picking, waste reporting, recall management. Usually tracked per batch/lot.                 |
| Serial / Batch Tracking (Y/N)  | Requires tracking unique serials or batch/lot numbers                                                   | Mandatory for electronics (warranty/returns), pharma/food (recalls), regulated items. Increases complexity but required for traceability. |
| Location (Warehouse → Rack → Bin) | Default storage position                                                                              | Speeds up put-away and picking. Supports multi-location businesses. Can be dynamic (WMS) or fixed.                                |
| Tax Group                      | Tax rule/category (VAT 20%, zero-rated, exempt)                                                         | Automates correct tax calculation on sales & purchases. Wrong group = tax errors, fines.                                          |
| Image                          | Product photo                                                                                           | Visual verification in warehouse, e-commerce display, mobile app, quality checks.                                                |
| Status                         | Active / Discontinued / Seasonal / Blocked                                                              | Prevents selling obsolete items, hides from POS/search, archives old SKUs without deleting history.                              |

### Detailed Explanations – Product Master
- **SKU/Product ID**: Never reuse deleted SKUs. Prefix by category/brand if scaling (helps humans).
- **Cost Price**: Track history if using FIFO/LIFO/weighted average costing.
- **Reorder Level/Quantity**: Should be dynamic — recalculated based on updated lead time, demand forecast.
- **Batch/Serial**: If Yes, system must enforce entry during receiving & picking.
- **Expiry**: Critical industries must block sales of expired stock automatically.

This master data structure, when properly maintained, directly supports all core business goals (accurate stock tracking, forecasting, supplier performance, accountability).

You can expand later with:
- Multi-currency fields
- Custom attributes (color, size, weight, dimensions)
- Approval flags
- Integration IDs (Shopify, QuickBooks, etc.)
