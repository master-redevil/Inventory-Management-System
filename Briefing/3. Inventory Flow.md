# Inventory Flow Modules Documentation

## 1. Purchase Order (PO) Module

This module manages the entire lifecycle of purchasing goods from suppliers in an inventory management system.

### Process Flow

The Purchase Order follows a sequential workflow:

**Create PO → Approve → Send to Supplier → Await Delivery → Receive Goods → Update Stock**

- **Create PO**: Initiate a new purchase order with required details.
- **Approve**: Review and approve the PO (typically by a manager or authorized personnel).
- **Send to Supplier**: Transmit the approved PO to the supplier (via email, portal, etc.).
- **Await Delivery**: Wait for the supplier to fulfill and ship the order.
- **Receive Goods**: Physically receive and inspect the delivered items.
- **Update Stock**: Record the received quantities into the inventory system, increasing stock levels.

### Key Fields

The Purchase Order module typically includes the following fields:

- **PO Number**  
  A unique identifier for the purchase order (auto-generated or manual).

- **Supplier**  
  The name or ID of the supplier/vendor providing the goods.

- **Ordered Items**  
  List of items being purchased (often includes item code, description, unit price, etc.).

- **Qty Ordered**  
  Quantity of each item requested in the purchase order.

- **Expected Date**  
  The anticipated delivery or arrival date for the goods.

- **Status**  
  Current state of the PO. Possible values:  
  - **Draft** – PO is being created or edited  
  - **Approved** – PO has been reviewed and authorized  
  - **Received** – Goods have been delivered and recorded  
  - **Closed** – PO is fully completed and no further action needed

### Purpose in Inventory Management

The Purchase Order module ensures:
- Proper authorization before committing to purchases
- Accurate tracking of incoming inventory
- Clear communication with suppliers
- Reliable stock updates to prevent stockouts or overstocking

This structured approach helps maintain inventory accuracy, supports financial reconciliation (with invoices), and provides an audit trail for procurement activities.
