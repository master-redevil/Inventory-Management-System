# Goods Receipt Note (GRN) in Inventory Management

## What is a Goods Receipt Note (GRN)?

A **Goods Receipt Note (GRN)**, also known as a Goods Received Note, is a key document and process in inventory and procurement systems. It is created when goods are physically received from a supplier, usually against a previously issued Purchase Order (PO).

### Primary Purposes of a GRN
- Formally records and verifies that goods have actually been delivered
- Documents the **actual quantity** and condition of items received (which may differ from what was ordered)
- Serves as proof of receipt for payment processing (part of 3-way matching: PO + GRN + Invoice)
- **Triggers the increase in inventory stock levels** in the system
- Provides an audit trail for quality checks, discrepancies, and accountability

**Critical Rule**:  
**"Stock increases only here."**  
Inventory quantities are **not** updated when a purchase order is created, approved, or sent to the supplier. Stock levels are only increased when the GRN is created and approved. This ensures that the system's recorded stock always matches what is physically present in the warehouse.

## Key Fields in the GRN Module

- **GRN No**  
  Unique system-generated identifier for the goods receipt record.

- **PO Reference**  
  The Purchase Order number this receipt relates to. Links the GRN to the original order for easy tracking and reconciliation.

- **Received Qty**  
  The actual quantity of each item physically received and accepted (may be less than or equal to the ordered quantity).

- **Batch / Serial**  
  Batch number (for lot-tracked items like food or pharmaceuticals) or serial number (for individually identifiable items like electronics).

- **Expiry**  
  Expiry date of the received batch — essential for managing perishable or time-sensitive stock.

- **Location Stored**  
  Specific storage location (e.g., warehouse aisle, bin, or shelf) where the goods are placed after receipt.

- **Inspector Name**  
  Name or ID of the person who inspected and verified the delivery. Ensures quality control and clear responsibility.

## Process Context

The GRN is typically created during the **"Receive Goods"** stage of the procurement process:

Await Delivery → Receive Goods (Create GRN) → Update Stock

Once the GRN is completed and approved:
- Stock levels are increased based on the **Received Qty**
- Any shortages, damages, or discrepancies can be recorded and reported
- The linked Purchase Order can be partially or fully closed
- Finance can match the supplier invoice and process payment

## Benefits of a Dedicated GRN Process

- Ensures accurate physical-to-system stock synchronization
- Prevents premature or inflated stock counts
- Supports batch/serial/expiry tracking for compliance (especially in regulated industries)
- Assigns clear accountability through inspector recording
- Provides strong internal controls and full audit readiness

By strictly updating stock only at the GRN stage, the system maintains high inventory accuracy and integrity throughout the receiving process.
