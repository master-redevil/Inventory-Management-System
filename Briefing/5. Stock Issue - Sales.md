# Stock Issue / Sales in Inventory Management

## What is Stock Issue / Sales?

The **Stock Issue / Sales** module (also called Material Issue, Delivery Note, or Sales Dispatch) handles the process of removing items from inventory when they are sold to customers or issued to internal departments/projects.

This module records the outflow of goods and is the point where **inventory stock levels are decreased**. It ensures that stock is only reduced when items are physically handed over or dispatched, maintaining accurate real physical-to-system inventory balance.

**Critical Rule**:  
**"Stock decreases here."**  
Stock quantities are **not** reduced when a sales quotation or order is created — reduction happens only when the Stock Issue / Sales record is created and approved. This prevents premature depletion of inventory counts.

## Key Fields in the Stock Issue / Sales Module

- **Issue No**  
  Unique identifier for the stock issue or sales dispatch transaction (typically system-generated).

- **Customer / Department**  
  Specifies the recipient: either an external customer (for sales) or an internal department/project (for internal consumption or transfers).

- **Product**  
  The item(s) being issued or sold (includes product code, name, and description).

- **Qty**  
  The quantity of each product being issued or dispatched to the customer/department.

- **Price**  
  Unit selling price or issue price of the product (used for valuation and invoicing).

- **Tax**  
  Applicable tax amount or rate on the issued items (for correct billing and financial reporting).

- **Status**  
  Current state of the issue/sales transaction (e.g., Draft, Approved, Issued, Closed).

## Process Context

The Stock Issue / Sales transaction typically occurs after a sales order or requisition is approved and goods are ready for dispatch:

Sales Order / Requisition → Pick & Pack → Issue Goods (Create Stock Issue / Sales) → Stock Decreases

Once the Stock Issue / Sales record is completed and approved:
- Inventory stock levels are **reduced** by the issued **Qty**
- Cost of goods sold (COGS) can be calculated for accounting
- An invoice can be generated (if it's a customer sale)
- Delivery or dispatch documents can be printed
- Relevant sales order or requisition status is updated

## Benefits of a Dedicated Stock Issue / Sales Process

- Ensures stock is only deducted when goods physically leave the warehouse
- Provides accurate real-time inventory visibility
- Supports both external sales and internal consumption tracking
- Enables proper valuation (with price and tax) for financial accuracy
- Creates an audit trail for all stock movements outward
- Prevents stock discrepancies caused by premature deductions

By strictly decreasing stock only at this stage, the system guarantees that inventory records precisely reflect what is actually available in the warehouse, supporting reliable planning, reordering, and reporting.
