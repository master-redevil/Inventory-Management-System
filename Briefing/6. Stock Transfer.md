# Stock Transfer in Inventory Management

## What is Stock Transfer?

The **Stock Transfer** module manages the movement of inventory items between different locations within the same organization, such as from one warehouse, branch, store, or bin to another.

This process is used when stock needs to be relocated for reasons like:
- Balancing stock levels across locations
- Fulfilling demand at a different site
- Centralizing or decentralizing inventory
- Moving goods to a production area or sales floor

Unlike sales or issues, a stock transfer **does not increase or decrease total inventory quantity** across the organization — it only adjusts stock levels between specific locations (decreases at the source, increases at the destination).

## Key Fields in the Stock Transfer Module

- **Transfer No**  
  Unique identifier for the stock transfer transaction (usually system-generated for tracking and auditing).

- **From Location**  
  The source location (e.g., Warehouse A, Store Room, Bin #101) from which the stock is being moved.

- **To Location**  
  The destination location (e.g., Warehouse B, Retail Outlet, Production Floor) where the stock will be received.

- **Qty**  
  The quantity of the item being transferred.

- **Approved By**  
  Name or ID of the person who reviews and authorizes the transfer (ensures control and accountability).

## Process Context

A typical stock transfer flow:

Request Transfer → Create Transfer Record → Approve → Physically Move Goods → Confirm Receipt at Destination

Upon approval and completion:
- Stock is **deducted** from the **From Location**
- Stock is **added** to the **To Location**
- Total organizational inventory remains unchanged
- Full traceability of internal movements is maintained

Example shown in the interface:  
**Warehouse A → Warehouse B**

## Benefits of a Dedicated Stock Transfer Process

- Accurate tracking of stock across multiple locations
- Prevents unauthorized movement of inventory
- Maintains location-level stock accuracy for picking, sales, and reporting
- Provides clear audit trail (who approved, when, and where goods moved)
- Supports multi-warehouse or multi-branch operations efficiently
- Enables better demand fulfillment by redistributing stock where needed

By requiring approval and structured recording, the Stock Transfer module ensures internal stock movements are controlled, visible, and properly reflected in the inventory system without affecting overall stock valuation.
