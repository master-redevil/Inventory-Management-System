# Stock Adjustment in Inventory Management

## What is Stock Adjustment?

The **Stock Adjustment** module is used to correct inventory discrepancies when the physical stock count does not match the system's recorded quantity. It allows authorized personnel to manually increase or decrease stock levels for legitimate reasons.

This module is essential for maintaining inventory accuracy when unavoidable differences occur outside normal inflows (GRN) or outflows (Sales/Issue).

**Key Principle**:  
Every adjustment **must require a reason + supervisor approval**.  
This enforces control, prevents unauthorized changes, and ensures all adjustments are justified and audited.

## Common Reasons for Stock Adjustment

The module explicitly supports adjustments for:

- **Damage**  
  Goods that are broken, spoiled, or unusable (stock is reduced).

- **Theft**  
  Items lost due to theft or pilferage (stock is reduced).

- **Expiry**  
  Perishable or time-sensitive items that have expired (stock is reduced).

- **Counting difference**  
  Discrepancies found during physical stock counts or cycle counts (can increase or decrease stock depending on actual vs. system quantity).

Other valid reasons may also be recorded depending on system configuration.

## Key Rules and Controls

- **Mandatory Reason**  
  User must select or enter a clear reason for the adjustment.

- **Supervisor Approval Required**  
  All stock adjustments must be reviewed and approved by a supervisor or authorized manager before taking effect.  
  This prevents fraud, errors, or unauthorized stock manipulation.

- **Audit Trail**  
  The system records who requested, who approved, when, reason, and quantity adjusted.

## Process Context

Typical stock adjustment flow:

Identify Discrepancy → Create Adjustment Request (with Reason) → Supervisor Review → Approve/Reject → Apply Adjustment → Stock Updated

Upon approval:
- Stock quantity is increased or decreased accordingly
- Adjustment reason and approver are permanently logged
- Inventory valuation may be affected (especially for reductions due to damage/theft)

## Benefits of a Controlled Stock Adjustment Process

- Maintains inventory accuracy despite real-world discrepancies
- Prevents abuse or fraudulent stock changes through mandatory approval
- Provides clear visibility into sources of stock loss (damage, theft, expiry)
- Supports accurate financial reporting by properly accounting for losses
- Enables analysis of recurring issues (e.g., frequent damage in a location)
- Ensures compliance with audit and governance requirements

By requiring both a valid reason and supervisor approval, the Stock Adjustment module balances the need for flexibility with strong internal controls, protecting inventory integrity.
