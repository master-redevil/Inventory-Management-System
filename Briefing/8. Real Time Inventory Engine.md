# Realtime Inventory Engine in Inventory Management

## What is the Realtime Inventory Engine?

The **Realtime Inventory Engine** is the core calculation layer of an inventory management system. It continuously tracks and computes stock levels for **every product** in real-time, ensuring that the system always reflects accurate, up-to-date inventory information.

It automatically updates stock balances whenever any inventory transaction occurs (e.g., Goods Receipt, Stock Issue/Sales, Stock Transfer, or Stock Adjustment). This eliminates manual calculations and provides instant visibility into current stock status.

The engine maintains stock **per product** (and often per location/warehouse) using a perpetual inventory method.

## Key Metrics Tracked for Every Product

The Realtime Inventory Engine stores and displays the following essential metrics:

- **Opening Balance**  
  The stock quantity at the beginning of a period (e.g., start of day, month, or financial year). Serves as the baseline for all subsequent calculations.

- **Total In**  
  Cumulative quantity added to stock during the period.  
  Sources: Goods Receipt Notes (GRN), positive stock adjustments, incoming transfers, returns from customers, etc.

- **Total Out**  
  Cumulative quantity removed from stock during the period.  
  Sources: Stock Issues/Sales, negative adjustments, outgoing transfers, damages, theft, expiry write-offs, etc.

- **Current Balance**  
  The calculated current physical stock level.  
  Formula:  
  **Current Balance = Opening Balance + Total In − Total Out**

- **Reserved Stock**  
  Quantity that has been committed or allocated for approved sales orders, production orders, or transfers but not yet physically issued.  
  This stock is not available for new commitments.

- **Available Stock**  
  The quantity actually free and ready for sale or use.  
  Formula:  
  **Available Stock = Current Balance − Reserved Stock**

- **Reorder Status**  
  Indicates whether the product needs replenishment based on predefined reorder rules (e.g., reorder point, minimum stock level).  
  Common statuses:  
  - Normal  
  - Low Stock  
  - Reorder Suggested  
  - Critical / Out of Stock

## How the Engine Works

The Realtime Inventory Engine operates silently in the background:

1. Every approved transaction (GRN, Issue, Transfer, Adjustment) instantly updates **Total In** or **Total Out**.
2. **Current Balance** is recalculated immediately.
3. **Reserved Stock** is updated when sales/production orders are confirmed.
4. **Available Stock** and **Reorder Status** are derived in real-time.
5. All reports, dashboards, and alerts use these live values.

## Benefits of a Realtime Inventory Engine

- Provides instant, accurate stock visibility across the organization
- Prevents overselling by distinguishing between total and available stock
- Enables proactive reordering through reorder status alerts
- Supports better decision-making with reliable data
- Eliminates period-end stock reconciliation surprises
- Facilitates multi-location tracking when combined with location-specific balances

By maintaining these metrics in real-time for every product, the inventory engine ensures full control, reduces stockouts and overstocking, and forms the foundation for efficient inventory management.
