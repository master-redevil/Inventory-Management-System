# Reporting System in Inventory Management

## What is the Reporting System?

The **Reporting System** is the analytical and oversight layer of an inventory management system. It transforms raw transaction data into actionable insights, helping businesses monitor performance, identify issues, ensure compliance, and make informed decisions.

The tagline in the interface — **"This is where software becomes professional"** — emphasizes that robust reporting elevates basic stock tracking into a professional, enterprise-grade inventory management solution.

A well-designed reporting system provides:
- Real-time and scheduled reports
- Clear visibility into stock health and movement
- Early warnings for potential problems
- Audit-ready documentation

## Types of Reports

### Daily Reports
These reports focus on immediate operational needs and day-to-day monitoring:

- **Stock in / Stock out**  
  Summary of all goods received and issued during the day (helps reconcile daily movements).

- **Fast moving items**  
  Products with high sales/issue velocity — useful for identifying popular items and optimizing stock placement.

- **Zero stock**  
  List of items currently at zero quantity — critical for preventing stockouts and triggering urgent reordering.

- **Near expiry**  
  Items approaching their expiry date — essential for perishable goods to minimize waste and prioritize sales/use.

### Monthly Reports
These provide deeper analysis over a longer period:

- **Dead stock**  
  Items that have had no movement (in or out) for an extended period (e.g., 6–12 months). Helps identify obsolete or unsellable inventory.

- **Overstock**  
  Items with excessively high quantities compared to consumption rate — highlights capital tied up in slow-moving stock.

- **Consumption rate**  
  Average usage/sales per period for each item — key input for demand forecasting and reorder planning.

- **Supplier performance**  
  Evaluation of suppliers based on delivery timeliness, quality, shortages, etc. — supports better vendor management.

### Audit Reports
These ensure traceability, accountability, and compliance:

- **User activity logs**  
  Record of all actions performed by users (who did what and when) — vital for security and responsibility tracking.

- **Adjustment history**  
  Full log of all stock adjustments (reason, quantity, approver, date) — prevents fraud and explains discrepancies.

- **Stock movement ledger**  
  Complete chronological record of every stock transaction (GRN, issues, transfers, adjustments) — serves as the ultimate audit trail.

## Benefits of a Professional Reporting System

- Proactive issue detection (low stock, expiry, dead stock)
- Optimized inventory levels (reduce overstock and stockouts)
- Improved cash flow by minimizing tied-up capital
- Better supplier and purchasing decisions
- Full compliance with internal controls and external audits
- Data-driven management instead of guesswork

By delivering targeted daily, monthly, and audit reports, the Reporting System turns transactional data into strategic intelligence, making the inventory software truly professional and indispensable for serious business operations.
